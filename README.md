# Minesweeper NoJS
HTML+CSS Minesweeper game without JS

You can play it on GitHub Pages:
https://valent-in.github.io/mines-no-js/

This game was written in July 2018 as learning project.

This is not "true" Minesweeper!
Not all functions from original game implemented due to CSS limitations:

* Only 5600 different placement patterns can be generated by it's "randomizer".
* Also only one board (8x8) is available.
* Lack of right mouse click (click in field corner to set flag or use top buttons to switch mode).
* All 10 flags must be set correctly to win game (just opening free areas is not enough... even not requiered).
